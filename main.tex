\begin{abstract}
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain cancer with grim
prognosis. Its morphology is characterized by layered structure, i.e.,
an inner necrotic core and an outer rim of proliferating cells. This
structure can be observed in magnetic resonance images images. A mathematical
model of GBM growth with explicit birth and death rate is proposed.
This model demonstrates a traveling wave. We develop a method to compute
some characteristics of the approximate wave profile, which can be
matched with image data. Various forms of growth and death terms and
their parameter identifiability are studied. We use image data of
GBM patients to get personalized parameterization of the model, of
which the biological and clinical implications are discussed.

\section{Introduction}

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a type of the most aggressive brain
cancer. Patients with GBM have a mean survival length less than 15
months from the time of diagnosis \cite{Norden2006}. Its fast progression
is characterized by highly proliferating and invasive cancer cells.
Its tumor morphology manifests a layered structure: there is a necrotic
core at the center, a band of proliferating cells at the outer rim
and a transition layer of quiescent cancer cells in between. The tumor
can be visualized by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which is commonly
used to inform clinical decisions. One of the hallmarks of GBM is
its heterogeneity between individual patients, imposing a challenge
to its treatment. 

Mathematical modeling can offer a way to tackle this challenge. Mathematical
modeling has provided a lot of insight to our understanding of cancer
and its treatment \cite{Kuang}. Mathematical models on GBM are abundant
(see \cite{GBMreview} for a review). A popular type of those models
employs reaction-diffusion equations. In many cases \cite{Harley2014,Gerlee2016,Stepien2018},
those systems exhibit a traveling wave solution of which the speed
is of great interests since it is related to how fast cancer progress. 

However, models which confront the heterogeneity of GBM directly by
utilizing spatio-temporal patient-specific data are rare. Swanson
and her collaborators \cite{Swanson2008,Neal2013,Jackson2015a} is
one of the few teams which focus on this endeavor. They used the well-known
Fisher's equation \cite{FISHER1937} (called PI model in \cite{Jackson2015a})
and parameterized it using MR images. The estimated proliferation
and diffusion parameters and a model-derived metric called days gained
are deemed to be instrumental to clinical treatments. But their treating
the cancer cells as a single species is an oversimplification and
by doing so the structured morphology of GBM has to be ignored. Although
there are modeling works taking into account of multi-species nature
of cancer cells \cite{Eikenberry2009,Swanson2011}, they are oftentimes
too complicated to be practically useful given scarcity of image data
of an individual patient. To fill this gap, we propose a model which
includes two species of cancer cells, i.e., proliferating and quiescent,
and is capable of exploiting the structural information offered by
one or two MR scans. 

Gliomas can only be imaged indirectly on MRI, and are typically characterized,
on T1-weighted sequences, by a large, often necrotic core region surrounded
by a bright enhancing rim that correlates with high blood vessel density
and (presumably) rapid cell proliferation. Finally, this core and
rim is usually surrounded by a large expanse of edema that is visible
on T2-weighted MRI, and may represent diffusely invasive, highly motile
cells. Thus, we have three basic signals from imaging: necrotic radius,
enhancing radius, and T2 (or maximum) radius. We hypothesized that
a relatively simple mathematical model framework can capture all three
signals, and yield insight into the relative contributions of cellular
proliferation, motility, and necrosis to each major feature.

The paper is organized as following. We first describe our model and
its assumptions. Then we demonstrate that the model has a traveling
wave solution and work out its approximate wave profile. We devise
a simple procedure to estimate the parameters by fitting the approximate
wave profile to image data, for which identifiability is checked.
This procedure is then applied to several patient-specific data. 



\section{Model and method}
\subsection{Model description}
To model the growth of GBM, we propose a system of reaction-diffusion
equations 

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:main3d}
\begin{eqnarray}
\pardiff pt & = & \nabla\cdot\bigg[\frac{Dp}{p+q}\nabla(p+q)\bigg]+\tilde{g}(w)p-\tilde{\delta}(w)p\\
\pardiff qt & = & \nabla\cdot\bigg[\frac{Dq}{p+q}\nabla(p+q)\bigg]+\tilde{\delta}(w)p,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}where two species are considered: proliferating
cells and quiescent cells whose density at time $t$ and location
$x$ is represented by $p(x,t)$ and $q(x,t)$ respectively. We assume
the flux of total population due to migration is $-D\nabla(p+q)$
where $D$ is a constant diffusion coefficient. It is further assumed
that the proportion of the total flux contributed by each species
equals their proportion of the total population. This diffusion term
is believed to be a realistic account of cancer cell movements \cite{Sherratt2001}. 

Per capita birth rate is $\tilde{g}(w)$ and the proliferating cells
become quiescent with per capita rate $\tilde{\delta}(w)$. Both of
them is a function of $w$. We define $w=1-p-q$, interpreted as availability
of space or some generic nutrient (we call it growth factor henceforth).
By doing so, we have scaled the maximum cell density to be 1. In our
model, necrosis is not explicitly included but can be thought of being
lumped into $q$. This choice is supported by the fact that MR only
visualizes proliferating cells and does not distinguish between quiescence
and necrosis, and the decision to keep the model simple enough so
that it makes use of available information without over-complicating
the problem. Note that quiescent cells can not become proliferating
again but only turns into necrosis. Therefore $\tilde{\delta}(w)$
can be thought of as death rate. 

In order to achieve biological meaning, we impose the following constraints
on $g(w)$ and $\delta(w)$: 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{g}'(w)\ge0,\tilde{\delta}'(w)\le0,\tilde{g}(1)\ge\tilde{\delta}(1)=0,\tilde{\delta}(0)>\tilde{g}(0)=0.\label{eq:1st assumption}
\end{equation}
That is, birth/death should increase/decrease with availability of
the growth factor, and there is more birth than death at maximum growth
factor while there is only death and no growth in absence of growth
factor. It is also assumed that death rate is negligible at maximum
growth factor. With those assumptions, it can be shown that the solution
of (\ref{eq:main3d}) stay nonnegtive and is bounded by $p+q\le1$
for all $t$ with suitable initial condition. 

We can estimate three parameters based on the three pieces of information
we can derive from MR images. Therefore we want a few more restrictions
on $\tilde{g}(w)$ and $\tilde{\delta}(w)$ for the ease of parameter
estimation and ensure their identifiability. Since we can only introduce
two more parameters in addition to diffusion coefficient $D$, we
introduce $\rho$ and $k$ into $\tilde{g}(w)$ and $\tilde{\delta}(w)$
respectively and indicate their dependence on the parameters as $\tilde{g}(w;\rho)$
and $\tilde{\delta}(w;k)$. It is desirable to make the proliferating
rate at maximum growth factor and death rate at zero growth factor
be $\rho$ and $\delta$, i.e., $\tilde{g}(1,\rho)=\rho,\ \tilde{\delta}(0;k)=k$.
For reasons that will become clear later, we pick the functional form
which can be written as $\tilde{g}(w;\rho)=\rho g(w)$ and $\tilde{\delta}(w;k)=k\delta(w)$.
Although we have stated several additional assumptions, it should
be noted that they impose little impact on the generality and flexibility
of our model. The benefit of including them will become clear in the
section of parameter estimation. 

\subsection{Approximate wave profile}
We consider one spatial dimension for simplicity. It is justified
by the fact that the tumor is mostly spherical and at the time of
diagnosis its radius is large enough so that radial effect is negligible.
Together with the aforementioned assumptions, the equations now write
as 

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:main}
\begin{eqnarray}
\pardiff pt & = & \pardiff{}x\bigg[\frac{Dp}{p+q}\pardiff{}x(p+q)\bigg]+\rho g(w)p-k\delta(w)p\\
\pardiff qt & = & \pardiff{}x\bigg[\frac{Dq}{p+q}\pardiff{}x(p+q)\bigg]+k\delta(w)p,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}We nondimensionlize the system using the characteristic
length $\sqrt{D/k}$ and the characteristic time $1/k$ so that $x=\sqrt{D/k}\hat{x}$
and $t=\hat{t}/k$, which leads to \begin{subequations}\label{eq:dpdt dqdt}
\begin{eqnarray}
\pardiff p{\hat{t}} & = & \pardiff{}{\hat{x}}\bigg[\frac{p}{p+q}\pardiff{}{\hat{x}}(p+q)\bigg]+\hat{\rho}g(w)p-\delta(w)p\\
\pardiff q{\hat{t}} & = & \pardiff{}{\hat{x}}\bigg[\frac{q}{p+q}\pardiff{}{\hat{x}}(p+q)\bigg]+\delta(w)p,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}where $\hat{\rho}=\rho/k$. We are seeking a traveling
wave solution, i.e., $p(\xi)=p(\hat{x}-c\hat{t}),q(\xi)=q(\hat{x}-c\hat{t})$
where $c$ is wave speed and there is a slight abuse of notation.
Substituting these into (\ref{eq:dpdt dqdt}) gives 

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:in wave cord}
\begin{eqnarray}
(\frac{p}{p+q}(p+q)')'+cp'+\hat{\rho}g(w)p-\delta(w)p & = & 0\\
(\frac{q}{p+q}(p+q)')'+cq'+\delta(w)p & = & 0,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations} where the prime indicates the derivative with
respect to $\xi$. Linearizing at the wave head, i.e., substitute
an ansztz $p=Ae^{-r\xi}$ and $q=Be^{-r\xi}$ into (\ref{eq:in wave cord})
gives $(r^{2}-cr+\rho)A=0$. The nontrivial $A$ entails the minimum
speed of the wave $c_{\min}=2\sqrt{\hat{\rho}}$ . It is numerically
verified that the minimum speed is exactly the asymptotic speed, i.e.,
$c=c_{\min}$.

To obtain a approximate wave profile, we adopt a method first used
by \cite{Canosa1973}. We rescale the wave coordinate $z=-\text{\ensuremath{\xi/c}}$,
which leads to

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:1/c^2}
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{c^{2}}(\frac{p}{p+q}(p+q)')'-p'+\hat{\rho}g(w)p-\delta(w)p & = & 0\label{eq:1/c^2a}\\
\frac{1}{c^{2}}(\frac{q}{p+q}(p+q)')'-q'+\delta(w)p & = & 0,\label{eq:1/c^2b}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}where the prime indicates the derivative with respect
to $z$. Assuming that $1/c^{2}$ is small, we neglect the first terms
of (\ref{eq:1/c^2a}),(\ref{eq:1/c^2b}). Writing the system in terms
of $p$ and $w$, we get the reduced system as below

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:pp system}
\begin{align}
\frac{dp}{dz} & =p(\hat{\rho}g(w)-\delta(w))\label{eq:dpdz}\\
\frac{dw}{dz} & =-\hat{\rho}pg(w),\label{eq:dwdz}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}which is amenable to phase plane analysis. The
approximate wave solution corresponds to a trajectory that leaves
$(0,1)$ and ends at $(0,w^{*})$ with $w^{*}\in[0,1)$ (see Figure
\ref{fig:pp}). Its existence based on assumptions (\ref{eq:1st assumption})
is shown in the appendix. With a specific choice of $g(w)$ and $\delta(w)$,
the trajectory can be found by taking(\ref{eq:dpdz}) over (\ref{eq:dwdz}),
which gives 
\[
\frac{dp}{dw}=\frac{\delta(w)}{\hat{\rho}g(w)}-1.
\]
 Upon integration we get $p$ as a function of $w$, i.e., $p=p(w)$,
which we will make use of in the next section.

wave}

\subsection{Parameter estimation}

We first discuss the three pieces of information which we can get
from MR images and fit our model to. There are two types of MR: T1
highlights high density of proliferating cells while T2 has a lower
detection threshold. We denote the their detection thresholds as $100\times a_{1}\%$
and $100\times a_{2}\%$ of $p_{\max}=\max_{z}\{p(z)\}$ (the actual
maximum density of proliferating cells given by the traveling wave
solution) with $a_{1}>a_{2}$. To fit our 1-D model, we convert necrotic
core volume, T1 volume and T2 volume into equivalent spheres with
their radius denoted by $R_{0},R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ (to do: figure
needed). Therefore, the width of proliferating rim denoted as $L_{1}$
and $L_{2}$ for T1 and T2 images can be calculated, i.e., $L_{1}=R_{1}-R_{0}$
and $L_{2}=R_{2}-R_{1}$. Typically, there are two MR scans before
surgery: one is at diagnosis and the other is right before surgery
with a usual time interval of a few weeks \cite{Swanson2008}. The
image-derived wave velocity $V$ is the change in tumor radius divided
by the length of this time interval. 

From our approximate wave profile, we can compute the corresponding
quantities to match with images (Figure \ref{fig:Match wid}). The
rim width (in dimensional form) is computed as below

\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\ell_{1} & = & \frac{\sqrt{D\rho}}{k}\int_{w_{1}^{-}}^{w_{1}^{+}}\frac{dz}{dw}dw\label{eq:l1}\\
\ell_{2} & = & \frac{\sqrt{D\rho}}{k}\int_{w_{1}^{+}}^{w_{2}}\frac{dz}{dw}dw,\label{eq:l2}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}where $w_{1}^{\pm}$ and $w_{2}$ satisfy $p(w_{1}^{\pm})=a_{1}p_{\text{max}},p(w_{2})=a_{2}p_{\max}$
(see also Figure \ref{fig:pp}). Additionally, model-derived wave
speed $c=2\sqrt{\rho D}$ can be matched with image-derived speed
$V$. Thus we have three nonlinear equations 
\begin{equation}
\{\ell_{1}=L_{1},\ell_{2}=L_{2},c=V\},\label{eq:l1l2c}
\end{equation}
 from which we hope to find parameters $D,\rho$ and $k$. Thanks
to the assumptions we made before, we can simply take the ratio of
(\ref{eq:l1}) and (\ref{eq:l2}), which gives 
\begin{equation}
f(\frac{\rho}{k})\equiv\frac{\int_{w_{1}^{-}}^{w_{1}^{+}}\frac{dz}{dw}dw}{\int_{w_{1}^{-}}^{w_{1}^{+}}\frac{dz}{dw}dw}=\frac{L_{1}}{L_{2}},\label{eq:f(rho/k)}
\end{equation}
where we note that the integrals are a function of $\rho/k$. (\ref{eq:f(rho/k)})
can be solved for $\rho/k$ analytically in special cases or numerically
in general. We note that the monotonicity of $f(\cdot)$ is important
for identifiability of parameters. Once we find $\rho/k$, it can
be back substitute to find all parameters. 

It is often observed in MR images that the tumor morphology is not
perfectly invariant over the course of tumor growth, i.e., the wave
profile changes over time. We suspect that the proliferating and diffusion
parameters ($\rho$ and $D$) can change because of mutation while
there is little change in $k$. In this sense, the procedure above
can be simply extended. For example, if MR images taken at two different
time gives different rim width $\{L_{1},L_{2}\},\{L_{1}',L_{2}'\}$,
then we can estimate $\rho,D,\rho',D',k$ by solving the following
system of 5 equations 
\[
\{\ell_{1}=L_{1},\ell_{2}=L_{2},\ell_{1}'=L_{1}',\ell_{2}'=L_{2}',V=\frac{2}{1/c+1/c'}\},
\]
where we have taken the image-derived wave speed be a harmonic mean
of model-derived wave speed at the two different times. It is motivated
by our belief that the mutation tends be correlated with tumor size
other than time. 

The above method requires two MR scans taken at two consecutive times
before surgery in order to obtain image-derived wave speed. If the
second image is not available, another approximation can be made to
rescue this situation. Generally, tumor age can be estimated by the
tumor radius divided by the wave speed. However, age estimation differs
in terms of which radius (say $R_{1}$ or $R_{2}$) to use. This discrepancy
can be explained by the common observation that tumor grows exponentially
at the initial stage and then linearly later on \cite{Kuang}. This
initial exponential growth stage needs to be taken into account as
a correction to the aforementioned tumor age estimation. The initial
exponential growth stage potentially affects the age estimation using
$R_{2}$ more than the one using $R_{3}$. Assuming that from $t=0$
to $t=t^{*}$, the T1 volume of the tumor expands exponentially and
then follows linear growth with speed $2\sqrt{\rho D}$, and that
exponential growth stage of T2 volume is negligible, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{R_{1}-r_{0}(e^{\rho t^{*}})^{1/3}}{2\sqrt{\rho D}}+t^{*} & = & \frac{R_{2}}{2\sqrt{\rho D}},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $r_{0}$ is the initial tumor radius and $t^{*}$ is the length
of the exponential growth stage. Replacing the last equation in (\ref{eq:l1l2c})
with the equation above, we have again three equations for which we
can solve for the three unknown parameters.

\section{Results}
We first investigate the monotonicity of $f(\cdot)$ for some specific
choice of $g(w)$ and $\delta(w)$ because it is crucial for parameter
identifiability. Given our restrictions on $g(w)$ and $\delta(w)$,
the cumulative density function (cdf) of Beta distribution family
suits our purposes ($\delta(w)=1-cdf(w)$). By tweeting the scale
and shape of beta distribution we can get linear, sigmoid and concave
up/down curves (see left pane of Figure \ref{fig:beta =000026 f}).
It turns out that our framework is very robust to those choices, i.e.,
monotonicity of $f(\cdot$) is well preserved (right pane of Figure
\ref{fig:beta =000026 f}). As we can see, the sigmoid shaped $g(w)$
and $\delta(w)$ give larger range of $f(\cdot)$ and thus more flexibility
in parameter estimation. Moreover, sigmoid curves are believed to
be biological relevant (most enzymatic reaction rates have the same
shape with respect to reactant concentration). Therefore, we focus
on this choice and move on to find patient specific parameters using
their MR images. 

We parameterize our model with patient's data in which there is only
one MR scan before surgery. In Table \ref{tab:Patient-data-para}
we summarize the image-derived tumor radii and the corresponding parameters
estimated by the method introduced in the previous section. We observe
substantial variation of the parameters among individual patients. 

We compare our approximate quantities to those obtained from the numerical
solution of the model. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:comparison-to-numerical},
the approximated results match with numerical results well except
for some discrepancy for $L_{2}$ when $\hat{\rho}$ is small. It
is not a surprise since the approximation is based on assumption of
large $c=2\sqrt{\hat{\rho}}$ . Moreover, numerical approximation
of $L_{2}$ is prone to errors due to the fixed grid size and large
rate of change around the threshold of $L_{2}$. Overall, we are convinced
that our approximation is accurate for the parameter range arisen
from the image data.

\section{Discussion}
The diffusion term in (\ref{eq:main}) falls into a general category
called cross diffusion \cite{Madzvamuse2017}, a phenomenon in which
the gradient in the concentration of one species can cause a flux
of another species. This type of cross diffusion considered here was
studied in a more general and theoretical context \cite{Sherratt2000}.
In \cite{Sherratt2001}, the authors justified the adoption of this
proportion-based cross diffusion in a tumor growth model by recognizing
that tumor cell migration is ``contact inhibited'', i.e., the presence
of one type of cell prevents the movements of the other. In other
words, the movements of one type of cell drags along other type of
cells with it. It is believed that this type of diffusion is more
realistic than simple linear diffusion (Fickian) in a sense that it
prevents unrealistic mixing of cells. Other types of density-dependent
diffusion are considered in modeling GBM migration \cite{Stepien2015a}.
Although a more complete picture of cell migration needs to include
mechanisms such as chemotaxis and haptotaxis, tumor growth is oftentimes
seen as diffusive and a careful choice of diffusion term is believed
to be sufficient to model cell migration in many cases. Although the
most accurate form of diffusion is debatable in the context of GBM,
we note that in our analysis the exact form of diffusion does not
matter since the second derivatives are dropped in (\ref{eq:1/c^2}).
The diffusion coefficient does play an important role in the linearized
wave head where it affects the wave speed, and in characteristic length
where its square root scales the space. Whereas the scale invariant
part of the wave profile is mostly determined by the exact form of
birth and death for which we did a thorough exploration. So we believe
that our model should capture the essence of the tumor morphology
revealed by MR images. 

Traveling wave solution is not uncommon in a reaction-diffusion system
and studies on this topic date back to \cite{FISHER1937}. Rigorous
proof of existence of traveling wave solution in a reaction-diffusion
system often leads to phase space analysis such as in \cite{Dunbar1983}.
Not only the high dimension but also the singularity represented in
the cross diffusion makes a proof a changeling task, which will the
the focus of future work. Nevertheless, the reduced system is reconcilable
to phase plane analysis and the orbit representing the traveling wave
solution can be identified (see appendix). 

Instead of having a lumped proliferation term as in \cite{Jackson2015a}
which only tracks net proliferation, our model treats birth and death
separately, making it possible to gauge the underlying total proliferation
of cancer cells. This is valuable information for personalized treatment
design since most chemotherapy and radiotherapy target proliferating
cells. Moreover, the structural information is also potential useful,
e.g., it may instruct drug dose so that the drug can perfuse through
the width of the proliferating rim. Research along this line has been
conducted using the PI model \cite{Kim2017}. We plan to investigate
along this line using our model in the future study. 

We recognize the possibility that the tumor is evolving over its course
of growth as the observed tumor profile at two different times is
not scale invariant. We suspect that the parameters of the model are
not constant over time. In this paper, we devise a method which uses
two MR images taken at two consecutive times before surgery, and our
method is feasible whether the two scans are consistent with invariant
tumor profile or not. It is straightforward to extend the current
method to make use of MR images taken at three or even more time points.
By updating parameters as more data is acquired, we are essentially
doing data assimilation. There has been research on applying full-fledged
data assimilation to cancer modeling \cite{Kostelich2011,McDaniel2013}.
Our method stands out being simple and computationally light-weighted.
In the case when only one per-surgery MR scan is available, we demonstrated
a way to estimate parameters involving mild and experimentally verifiable
assumptions. The major contributions of this paper is the novel way
to make use of scarce data which are the routinely available in clinical
settings. So we hope our method would offer wide and practical use
compared to large-scale computational models \cite{Eikenberry2009,Rutter2017},
which often focus on experimental data.

\section*{Supplementary (if necessary)}

We perform phase plane ($w$-$p$ plane) analysis of (\ref{eq:pp system})
to show the existence of a trajectory that starts from $(1,0)$ and
ends at $(w^{*},0)$ where $w^{*}\ge0$ if (\ref{eq:1st assumption})
are satisfied. First we note that $(1,0)$ is an unstable fixed point
and the trajectory starting here has slope $-1$ which is the direction
of the unstable manifold. Moreover 
\[
\frac{d^{2}p}{dw^{2}}=\frac{\delta'(w)g(w)-\delta(w)g'(w)}{\rho g(w)^{2}}<0
\]
for $w\in(0,1)$ because of the assumptions we had on $g$ and $\delta$.
It follows that the trajacory must remain below the line $p=1-w$.
Assuming $g(w)$ and $\delta(w)$ are continuous, there must be a
$w^{\dagger}\in(0,1)$ such that $\rho g(w^{\dagger})=\delta(w^{\dagger})$.
For $w>w^{\dagger}$, the trajectory has positive slope and hence
heading down to the $w$-axis. Since $\frac{dw}{dz}\vert_{w=0}=0$,
the trajectory cannot cross $p$-axis. Thus it must intersect the
$w$-axis at some $w^{*}\in(0,w^{\dagger})$
